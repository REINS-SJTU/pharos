This repository tried to solve the problem of spatial management for all transportation means in a human-robot coexistence environment. In other words, how to keep both vehicles and humans safe without controlling them directly. Multi-agent reinforcement learning is used to approach the solution, and the [mappo](mappo) implementation is a clone of [light_mappo](https://github.com/tinyzqh/light_mappo) with some modifications.
